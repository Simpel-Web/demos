# Testing Netlify Forms on a Gatsby Site using Cypress and Github Actions

**Important notice**  
The monthly running Github workflow is failing as the submittion of the form is currently disabled in the code (cf. [code snippet](https://github.com/Simpel-Web/demos/blob/36c4b88fe9f867b3c564844526f7c1ea23b666d1/netlify-forms-e2e-testing/src/components/form.js#L19-L34)) to prevent spam and unnecessary Netlify costs.
